Hey, I thought of teaching git tutorial to my friend. Can you create a repo named "git-tutorial" on my GitHub account?
Can you check the repository again?
Can you create a Readme file for this?
Create an issue for creating issue template!
Add an issue template to the repository.
Can you list all the issues in the repository?
Delete the Issue template from the repository.
Delete the repository "git-tutorial" from my GitHub account.
